                    My Name is Hunter Trammell, I am a Level 23 Human from San Diego, California currently residing in Overland Park, Kansas. 
                    I live with my wife: Ceri and our daughter: Murphy - She is great (well they both are but I am obsessed with my Daughter!).
                    Currently I work as an IT Help Desk Analyst for AMC Theatres and have been with the same company since I got my first job at one of their theatres as a crew member in High School.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not working and have some free time there are several things I enjoy doing. 
                    I am somewhat of a cinephile and enjoy watching the several hundred movies I have in my personal collection.
                    If I had to choose one topic that I am most interested in it would be Computer Hardware - I enjoy building PC's and fan-boying about the latest PC hardware on the market (Computex is a rough week for my wallet).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy computers a lot, I am A+ Certified and working with code is a new hobby of mine that I hope to blossom into a career.
                    In a perfect world, my dream job would getting paid to build high-end aestetically pleasing computers for people, but that is not a super realistic career path.
                    I love to create (i have penned a few novels - google it) and that is why I think that coding intrigues me so much.
                    From what was initially a one lined .html doc I was able to create this website using nothing but brainpower and a keyboard (with the google assist when my brain isnt where I want it to be).
                    Being able to build something out of nothing is very pleasing to me.
