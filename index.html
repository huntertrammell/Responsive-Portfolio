      <img src="assets/images/hunterPic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My Name is Hunter Trammell, I am a Level 23 Human from San Diego, California currently residing in Overland Park, Kansas. I live with my wife: Ceri and our daughter: Murphy - She is great (well they both are but I am obsessed with my Daughter!). Currently I work as an IT Help Desk Analyst for AMC Theatres and have been with the same company since I got my first job at one of their theatres as a crew member in High School.</p>

      <p>When I am not working and have some free time there are several things I enjoy doing. I am somewhat of a cinephile and enjoy watching the several hundred movies I have in my personal collection. If I had to choose one topic that I am most interested in it would be Computer Hardware - I enjoy building PC's and fan-boying about the latest PC hardware on the market (Computex is a rough week for my wallet).</p>

      <p>I enjoy computers a lot, I am A+ Certified and working with code is a new hobby of mine that I hope to blossom into a career. In a perfect world, my dream job would getting paid to build high-end aestetically pleasing computers for people, but that is not a super realistic career path. I love to create (i have penned a few novels - google it) and that is why I think that coding intrigues me so much. From what was initially a one lined .html doc I was able to create this website using nothing but brainpower and a keyboard (with the google assist when my brain isnt where I want it to be). Being able to build something out of nothing is very pleasing to me.</p>
